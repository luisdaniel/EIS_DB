  problem_statement:  "Mexico's war on drugs has led Monterrey, my hometown, to the City's worst social crisis. Additionally, it has the lowest citizen participation rate of the country, largely due to a lack of space where people could have meaningful partipacion and engagement. Efforts regarding the awareness and imagination of a bigger spectrum of users are now necessary to continuously grow communities of data users, and encourage data 'ownership'."

  why_compelling: The creation of government data portals has been a popular approach
    to make this possible (Data.gov currently lists over 300 government open data
    sites at https://www.data.gov/open-gov/). These portals make it easier for people
    to find data provided by the government, but providing easier access to data is

  problem_statement: In 2012, only 58% of eligible voters voted in the presidential
    election and only 41% voted in the 2010-midterm elections. However, Winooski is

    (68%), a high (for Vermont) percentage of non-English speaking homes (13%), and
    a very young population.

  problem_statement: The absence of design values and practices in government organizations
    has both immediate and long-term consequences. Citizen satisfaction with government
    services is incredibly low, creating a low-trust relationship that further constrains
    governments abilities to formulate and address policy objectives. In the past
    decades, design innovations focused on the end-user experience have transformed
    private sector organizations and industries. Failing to adopt these well-established
    innovations is in preventing government services from realizing opportunities
    to be more effective, efficient, far-reaching and humane.

  why_compelling: That fact is, the provision of public services is often poorly designed.

    with useful benefits, the prospect of interacting with our government often raises
    the specter of frustration, uncertainty, and anxiety. We distrust government with

  problem_statement: 'There are certain technical certification courses that have
    gained importance and have a critical standing in the candidate evaluation during
    the hiring process. These short courses are not taught in the Universities. Hence
    students with good profiles are not finding the right employment even after attaining
    degrees and employers are not getting the talent with right skills.

    The second part of the problem is selection of the right competencies. Degrees
    have a broad scope, they select a field but specialization is in the form of certifications  and
    the problem is to know what will be the right skills to acquire or what skills
    are demanded by employers.

    The third part of the is the training in these modules. There is online support
    but its lacks as a complete support for learning due to fragmentation, inconsistency
    and credibility issues of the information.

    The fourth part is the cost. Nobody wants to spend after bearing the burden of
    huge student debts. There is a need for inexpensive and effective way of learning.
